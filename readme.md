# Install

You need to download the BepInEx-Unity.Mono-win-x64 from https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be

First install BepInEx Mono by just putting all the files from the zip into your FAPI game folder (in steam app folder)

Once you have done that, you need to run the game once, a terminal will open and bepinex will generate a few files.

After that, just download the plugin in the release area, and place the folder FapiQolPlugin into the "SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Farmer Against Potatoes Idle\BepInEx\plugins" folder
